# mountain-pig

Utilities for use with Apache Pig (http://hadoop.apache.org/pig)

The name is from my sister's dog, Hank, a little porker who'll climb anything.
Here's a picture of him in action:

Besides, I figured "mountain-pig" is no more ridiculous a name that Twitter's
"elephant-bird" library. :-) (http://github.com/kevinweil/elephant-bird/)

## Requirements

1. Pig 0.6
2. Leiningen

## Build

1. lein deps
2. lein javac
3. lein jar

Note that "lein uberjar" doesn't do the right thing yet.

## Run

Set PIG_CLASSPATH:
    PIG_CLASSPATH=lib/*:mountain-pig-0.1.0.jar

Run:
    pig -x local sample.pig

Output should look like:

    ....
